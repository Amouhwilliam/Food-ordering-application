# Inplementation
In this project, we implemented a mobile app user interface made in FIGMA, with React Native, We used Expo to develop the app, you can take a look at the doc here https://docs.expo.io/ .
To setup the environment, please follow these steps:

    -   npm install 

    -   yarn start

# Testing
The app could be test on any devices but we recommend to use an Iphone X or a more recent Iphone as it's developed and tested on a Iphone XS Max.In the app we have 3 interfaces, both are almost the same but have some differences. You can access them by clicking the home, the heart and the person icons in the bottom tab.

# Have fun :)
